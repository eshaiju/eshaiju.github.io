  <p><a href='http://www.deccanrubyconf.org/'>Deccan RubyConference</a> is a Single-Track Conference happening at Pune every year. Deccan RubyConf 2017 took place 12th Aug. 2017 at Sheraton Grand Pune. The conference covered areas like Ruby Language, Framework, and Tools by well-known speakers and also few first-time speakers from Ruby community.</p>

 I got a chance to attend This year edition as speaker. My topic was <strong><a href='http://slides.com/shaijunonu/graphql-8'>Give REST a rest, use GraphQL for your next Ruby API</a></strong>. In my 25 minutes session, I talked about why should we use GraphQL and also about its implementation in Ruby. After conference session few people from different companies approached me and asked about GraphQL which was really a confidence booster for me as a speaker. Few people shared the issues they faced in GraphQL which given me new ideas and thought process.
