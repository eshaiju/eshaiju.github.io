<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><span style="color: #222222;">Writing a Ruby Gem was my long time wish, but i couldn't find an idea to make a gem. Finally got it, for which i didn't find a gem, a generator which will automatically generate a custom code for handling 404 and 500 errors and pages in rails application (Thanks to Sreekanth for noting there is no &nbsp;gem for this taks). Here it is&nbsp;</span></div>
{% codeblock %}
  rails_error_pages 1.0.5
{% endcodeblock %}
How to use :
<br/>
Simply add it to your Gemfile and bundle install.
{% codeblock %}gem 'rails_error_pages'{% endcodeblock %}
Next step is to use a generator, to add auto generated code into our application using
{% codeblock %}rails g rails_error_pages{% endcodeblock %}
That's it! run your application and try with a false URL. <br/></div></div>
