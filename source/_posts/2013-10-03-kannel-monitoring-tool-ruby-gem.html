  <div>Last few months I have been facing lots of issues in kannel SMS gateway.Some time sms are getting queued up, in some other time smsc went to reconnecting stage. I searched for a tool which will monitor kannel status Unfortunately i didn't find a tool to monitor and give alert. so decided to write a tool which will monitor kannel activities.</div>
  {% codeblock %}
    kannel_monitor 0.0.2
  {% endcodeblock %}
  This gem will monitor<br />
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;kannel status</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;kannel sms queue</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;smsc status</li>
    <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;smsc queue and will send a email alerts when something went wrong.</li>
  </ul>
  Just install gem in server using 
    {% codeblock %}
      gem install kannel_monitor
    {% endcodeblock %}
  run monitoring activity using command 
  {% codeblock %}
    kannel_monitor 'path to kannel_monitor.yml'
  {% endcodeblock %}
   Example of <b>yml</b> file is given&nbsp;<b><a href="https://github.com/shaijunonu/kannel-monitor/blob/master/config/kannel_monitor.yml" style="color: #1155cc;">Here</a>.
   </b><br /><span>you need to set a crone job to run this in a specific intervals. If a smsc is permanently reconection stage and you don't want to monitor that smsc, then you can skip that particular smsc by adding in <b>sms_to_be_skipped&nbsp;</b></span>
</div></div>
